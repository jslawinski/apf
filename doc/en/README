INTRO
=====

Active  port  forwarder  is  a  software  tool  for  secure   port   forwarding.
It uses ssl to increase security of communication between a server and a client.
Originally, it was developed to forward data point to point.  However, the  need
for bypassing firewalls in order to  connect  to  internally  located  computers
influenced the further development of the project.

AF is dedicated for people, who don't have an external ip  number  and  want  to
make some services available across the net.

Moreover, zlib is used to compress the transferred data.

Using one, permanent data/control channel with flow control /  packet  buffering
provides good performance and reasonably small latency.

Multiple clients allow to create more sophisticated tunneling scheme.

  -U, --reverseudp    - reverse udp forwarding. Udp packets will be forwarded
                        from hostname:portnum (-p) to the server name:portnum
                        (-m)

 HTTP PROXY:

  -P, --proxyname     - the name of the machine with proxy server
  -X, --proxyport     - the port used by proxy server (default: 8080)


================================================================================

========================
3. REMOTE ADMINISTRATION
========================

Afclient can be started in remote administration  mode  by  '-r,  --remoteadmin'
option. Required option: '-n, --servername NAME'.

After successful authorization stdin/stdout is used to  communicate  with  user.
All the commands parsing is done by afserver.

Currently available commands are:

       help
         display help

       lcmd
         lists available commands

       info
         prints info about server

       rshow
         display realms

       cshow X
         display clients in X realm

       ushow X
         display users in X realm

       quit
         quit connection

       timeout N X
         set timeout value in X realm

       audit {0|1} X
         set audit mode in X realm

       dnslookups {0|1} X
         set dnslookups mode in X realm

       dateformat S
         set dateformat

       kuser S
         kick user named S

       kclient N
         kick client with number N


Afclient with '-p, --portnum PORT' option listens for connection  from  user  at
NAME:PORT.  NAME is set by '-d, --hostname' option or hostname() function,  when
the option is missing.

When user quits (close the connection or send 'quit' command),  afclient  exits.

================================================================================

=====================
4. HTTP PROXY TUNNELS
=====================

Afclient can communicate with afserver via HTTP proxy. In order to use this
feature, afserver must be started with '-P, --enableproxy' option. Afclient must
specify the proxy host ('-P, --proxyname' option) and port ('-X, --proxyport'
option).

Afclient with HTTP proxy mode enabled can still accept connections from
afclients, which don't use HTTP proxy mode.

================================================================================

==========
5. LOGGING
==========

Logging can be enabled by '-o, --log' option. The argument to this option must
be in the form:
  target,description,msgdesc

Where
  target is file or sock
  description is filename or host,port
  msgdesc is the subset of:
    LOG_T_ALL,
    LOG_T_USER,
    LOG_T_CLIENT,
    LOG_T_INIT,
    LOG_T_MANAGE,
    LOG_T_MAIN,
    LOG_I_ALL,
    LOG_I_CRIT,
    LOG_I_DEBUG,
    LOG_I_DDEBUG,
    LOG_I_INFO,
    LOG_I_NOTICE,
    LOG_I_WARNING,
    LOG_I_ERR

    written without spaces.


  Example:
  
  file,filename,LOG_T_MANAGE,LOG_I_ALL

================================================================================

==========
6. MODULES
==========

Afclient can use external modules for user's packets  filtering  ('-l,  --load')
and service's packets filtering ('-L, --Load'). Module file has to declare three
functions:

char* info(void);
  
  info() return values:
  - info about module

  Example:

  char*
  info(void)
  {
    return "Module tester v0.1";
  }

int allow(char* host, char* port);

  allow() return values:
  0 - allow to connect
  !0 - drop the connection

  Example:

  int
  allow(char* host, char* port)
  {
    return 0; /* allow to connect */
  }

int filter(char* host, unsigned char* message, int* length);

  filter() return values:
  0 - allow to transfer
  1 - drop the packet
  2 - drop the connection
  3 - release the module
  4 - drop the packet and release the module
  5 - drop the connection and release the module

  Example:

  int
  filter(char* host, unsigned char* message, int* length)
  {
    int i;
    for (i = 1; i < *length; ++i) {
      if (message[i-1] == 'M') {
        if (message[i] == '1') {
          return 1; /* ignored */
        }
        if (message[i] == '2') {
          return 2; /* dropped */
        }
        if (message[i] == '3') {
          return 3; /* release */
        }
        if (message[i] == '4') {
          return 4; /* ignored + release */
        }
        if (message[i] == '5') {
          return 5; /* dropped + release */
        }
      }
    }
    return 0; /* allow to transfer */
  }

Modules have to be compiled with '-fPIC -shared' options.

7. EXAMPLES

  7.1 tcp mode
  ------------

                    local network   |FireWall|   Internet
                                        ||
                                        ||                           User 1
                                        ||                           /(tcp)
             AF Client <---Encrypted/Compressed channel---> AF Server
             /                          ||                    |      \(tcp)
            /(tcp)                      ||               (tcp)|       User 2
           /                            ||                     \
    Http server                         ||                      User 3
                                        ||


The use of it is extremely simple. Let's suppose we want to create a http server
on our computer and we are behind a masquerade or a firewall:

1) We have to find some machine on the net with  an  external  ip  and  a  shell
   account.
   
2) Use "make" to compile everything on that machine. (you can freely remove the
   afclient and client.rsa files)

3) You can edit the config file or just type from the console (to use the config
   type -f <cfgfile>) :
        $ ./afserver
   This will work, if you want to use default values:
   - hostname will be taken from hostname function  (it  would  be  ideally,  if
     there is appropriate registration in /etc/hosts)
   - server will be listening for users on port 50127
   - server will be listening for client on port 50126
   - server will be for maximum 5 users
   - server will forward tcp packets
   - there will be no logging and no verbose messages
   - there will be no password identification
   - ip protocol family will be unspecified

4) We use "make" on our machine (we can delete everything apart from afclient
   and client.rsa)

5) We are typing from the console:
        $ ./afclient -n <name of the server> -p 80
   Where <name of the server>  is  a  string  like  :  'bastion.univ.gda.pl'  or
   '153.19.7.200'

6) We can now enter with a web-browser to: <name of  the  server>:50127  and  we
   will enter to our computer in the fact.

  7.2 reverse udp mode
  --------------------

                    local network   |FireWall|   Internet
                                        ||                     (udp)
                                        ||              User 1-------AF Client
                                        ||                           /(tcp)
             AF Client <---Encrypted/Compressed channel---> AF Server
             /                          ||                    |      
            /(udp)                      ||               (tcp)|       
           /                            ||                   /
    Game server                         ||               AF Client-------User 2
                                        ||                         (udp)


Let's see how to use af to forward udp packets. Suppose we want to create a game
server on our computer (udp port 27960 on our machine):

1) - 4)  is  the  same  like  in  example  1.  (but  we  add  option:  -p  udp)

5) We are typing from the console:
  $ ./afclient -u -n <name of the server> -p 27960
   Where <name of the server> is a name (or ip) of a host where  our  server  is
   running.

6) Connecting to our game is more complicated. The user must use afclient to do
   this.  He has to specify the server he is connecting to and the  port,  which
   his program will be listening on:
       $ ./afclient -U -d <hostname> -p <portnum> -n <name of the server>  \
         -m <server port>
   Where <hostname> is the name of the user machine (who wants to connect to our
   game). <portnum> is the port he will be connecting to. <name of the server>
   is the name of the host where our server is running.  <server  port>  is  the
   port on which the server is listening for users.  In order to connect to  our
   game, the user has to connect to <hostname>:<portnum>.
