INTRO
=====

Active  port  forwarder  is  a  software  tool  for  secure   port   forwarding.
It uses ssl to increase security of communication between a server and a client.
Originally, it was developed to forward data point to point.  However, the  need
for bypassing firewalls in order to  connect  to  internally  located  computers
influenced the further development of the project.

AF is dedicated for people, who don't have an external ip  number  and  want  to
make some services available across the net.

Moreover, zlib is used to compress the transferred data.

Using one, permanent data/control channel with flow control /  packet  buffering
provides good performance and reasonably small latency.

Multiple clients allow to create more sophisticated tunneling scheme.

================================================================================

========================
3. REMOTE ADMINISTRATION
========================

  3.1 Usage
  ---------
  
Afclient can be started in remote administration  mode  by  '-r,  --remoteadmin'
option. Required option: '-n, --servername NAME'.

After successful authorization stdin/stdout is used to  communicate  with  user.
All the commands parsing is done by afserver.

  3.2 Commands
  ------------
  
Currently available commands are:

       help
         display help

       lcmd
         lists available commands

       info
         prints info about server

       rshow
         display realms

       cshow X
         display clients in X realm

       ushow X
         display users in X realm

       quit
         quit connection

       timeout N X
         set timeout value in X realm

       audit {0|1} X
         set audit mode in X realm

       dnslookups {0|1} X
         set dnslookups mode in X realm

       dateformat S
         set dateformat

       kuser S
         kick user named S

       kclient N
         kick client with number N


  3.3 States
  ----------
  
    3.3.1 Users
    -----------
    
    Connected users can be in several states:
    
       running
         user is properly connected and can send/receive data
         
       opening
         user is connected to afserver, but afclient hasn't confirmed connection
         with the destination. There is no traffic allowed in this situation.
         
       opening (closed)
         user was in 'opening' state, but 'kuser' command has been used and it's
         now queued for closing as soon as afclient will be ready to confirm
         this
         
       stopped
         user wasn't responsible, so all the packets addressed to it are queued.
         Afclient is informed to not receive any packets for this user.
         
       closing
         connection with user has been lost. Afclient has to confirm user
         deletion
         
       unknown
         probably afserver internal state has been corrupted.
         
         
    3.3.2 Clients
    -------------

    Connected clients can be in several states:
    
       running
         client is properly connected and can serve user's requests
         
       ssl handshake
         connection with client has been initialized and now ssl routines are
         negotiating all the details needed to establish secure tunnel. This
         stage with 'authorization' must not exceed the time set by 'timeout'
         option.
         
       authorization
         ssl tunnel is ready and afclient has to authorize itself to the
         afserver. This stage with 'ssl handshake' must not exceed the time set
         by 'timeout' option.
         
       unknown
         probably afserver internal state has been corrupted.


  3.4 Relay mode
  --------------

Afclient with '-p, --portnum PORT' option listens for connection  from  user  at
NAME:PORT.  NAME is set by '-d, --hostname' option or hostname() function,  when
the option is missing.

When user quits (close the connection or send 'quit' command),  afclient  exits.

================================================================================

=====================
4. HTTP PROXY TUNNELS
=====================

Afclient can communicate with afserver via HTTP proxy.  In  order  to  use  this
feature, afserver must be started with '-P, --enableproxy' option. Afclient must
specify the proxy host ('-P, --proxyname' option) and  port  ('-X,  --proxyport'
option).

Afclient with  HTTP  proxy  mode  enabled  can  still  accept  connections  from
afclients, which don't use HTTP proxy mode.

================================================================================

==========
5. LOGGING
==========

Logging can be enabled by '-o, --log' option. The argument to this option must
be in the form:
  target,description,msgdesc

Where
  target is file or sock
  description is filename or host,port
  msgdesc is the subset of:
    LOG_T_ALL,
    LOG_T_USER,
    LOG_T_CLIENT,
    LOG_T_INIT,
    LOG_T_MANAGE,
    LOG_T_MAIN,
    LOG_I_ALL,
    LOG_I_CRIT,
    LOG_I_DEBUG,
    LOG_I_DDEBUG,
    LOG_I_INFO,
    LOG_I_NOTICE,
    LOG_I_WARNING,
    LOG_I_ERR

    written without spaces.


  Example:
  
  file,filename,LOG_T_MANAGE,LOG_I_ALL

================================================================================

==========
6. MODULES
==========

Afclient can use external modules for user's packets  filtering  ('-l,  --load')
and service's packets filtering ('-L, --Load'). Module file has to declare three
functions:

char* info(void);
  
  info() return values:
  - info about module

  Example:

  char*
  info(void)
  {
    return "Module tester v0.1";
  }

int allow(char* host, char* port);

  allow() return values:
  0 - allow to connect
  !0 - drop the connection

  Example:

  int
  allow(char* host, char* port)
  {
    return 0; /* allow to connect */
  }

int filter(char* host, unsigned char* message, int* length);

  filter() return values:
  0 - allow to transfer
  1 - drop the packet
  2 - drop the connection
  3 - release the module
  4 - drop the packet and release the module
  5 - drop the connection and release the module

  Example:

  int
  filter(char* host, unsigned char* message, int* length)
  {
    int i;
    for (i = 1; i < *length; ++i) {
      if (message[i-1] == 'M') {
        if (message[i] == '1') {
          return 1; /* ignored */
        }
        if (message[i] == '2') {
          return 2; /* dropped */
        }
        if (message[i] == '3') {
          return 3; /* release */
        }
        if (message[i] == '4') {
          return 4; /* ignored + release */
        }
        if (message[i] == '5') {
          return 5; /* dropped + release */
        }
      }
    }
    return 0; /* allow to transfer */
  }

Modules have to be compiled with '-fPIC -shared' options.

================================================================================

================
7. MULTI TUNNELS
================

Since version 0.8  it's  possible  to  transfer  multiple  tunnels  in  the  one
afclient <-> afserver connection.

On the afserver we have to specify multiple listen ports with  the  same  manage
port.

When we set several '-p' options on the afclient, the new user connections  will
be distributed according  to  the  sequence  of  the  options,  i.e.   new  user
connecting to the second UsrCli pair  (with  the  same  manage  ports)  will  be
transferred to the destination pointed by the second '-p' option.

================================================================================

8. EXAMPLES
===========

  8.1 tcp mode
  ------------

                    local network   |FireWall|   Internet
                                        ||
                                        ||                           User 1
                                        ||                           /(tcp)
             AF Client <---Encrypted/Compressed channel---> AF Server
             /                          ||                    |      \(tcp)
            /(tcp)                      ||               (tcp)|       User 2
           /                            ||                     \
    Http server                         ||                      User 3
                                        ||


The use of it is extremely simple. Let's suppose we want to create a http server
on our computer and we are behind a masquerade or a firewall:

1) We have to find some machine on the net with  an  external  ip  and  a  shell
   account.
   
2) Use "make" to compile everything on that machine. (you can freely remove the
   afclient and client.rsa files)

3) You can edit the config file or just type from the console (to use the config
   type -f <cfgfile>) :
        $ ./afserver
   This will work, if you want to use default values:
   - hostname will be taken from hostname function  (it  would  be  ideally,  if
     there is appropriate registration in /etc/hosts)
   - server will be listening for users on port 50127
   - server will be listening for client on port 50126
   - server will be for maximum 5 users
   - server will forward tcp packets
   - there will be no logging and no verbose messages
   - there will be no password identification
   - ip protocol family will be unspecified

4) We use "make" on our machine (we can delete everything apart from afclient
   and client.rsa)

5) We are typing from the console:
        $ ./afclient -n <name of the server> -p 80
   Where <name of the server>  is  a  string  like  :  'bastion.univ.gda.pl'  or
   '153.19.7.200'

6) We can now enter with a web-browser to: <name of  the  server>:50127  and  we
   will enter to our computer in the fact.

  8.2 reverse udp mode
  --------------------

                    local network   |FireWall|   Internet
                                        ||                     (udp)
                                        ||              User 1-------AF Client
                                        ||                           /(tcp)
             AF Client <---Encrypted/Compressed channel---> AF Server
             /                          ||                    |      
            /(udp)                      ||               (tcp)|       
           /                            ||                   /
    Game server                         ||               AF Client-------User 2
                                        ||                         (udp)


Let's see how to use af to forward udp packets. Suppose we want to create a game
server on our computer (udp port 27960 on our machine):

1) - 4)  is  the  same  like  in  example  1.  (but  we  add  option:  -p  udp)

5) We are typing from the console:
  $ ./afclient -u -n <name of the server> -p 27960
   Where <name of the server> is a name (or ip) of a host where  our  server  is
   running.

6) Connecting to our game is more complicated. The user must use afclient to do
   this.  He has to specify the server he is connecting to and the  port,  which
   his program will be listening on:
       $ ./afclient -U -d <hostname> -p <portnum> -n <name of the server>  \
         -m <server port>
   Where <hostname> is the name of the user machine (who wants to connect to our
   game). <portnum> is the port he will be connecting to. <name of the server>
   is the name of the host where our server is running.  <server  port>  is  the
   port on which the server is listening for users.  In order to connect to  our
   game, the user has to connect to <hostname>:<portnum>.
